## Project plan and journey
Ths goal of this small project was to gain a new understanding of using lists that remove rows, present a second UI screen and save and load user data. Making the first UI page and second UI page was not difficult however I stumbled across an issue, "How do I save user input so that when the user reloads the app at a later date, their data is still present".
